### Special Note: Informed Consent

Our section of FS 101 has been asked by the FS Leadership Team (FSLT) to participate in its assessment plan. As part of this project, Dr. Bonham-Carter will be submitting samples of student work to the FSLT for analysis. Student names will be removed from all materials. All student work will then be anonymous, and individual students will not be identifiable to the readers.

Participation in this assessment plan will have no impact on studentsâ€™ course grades. If you do not want your work to be included for this study, please inform your professor. If you have any questions about this assessment plan, you may also contact the coordinator of the project, Dr. Jennifer Dearden.


#### Questions to consider

 - What is the policy?
 - What motivated this policy?
 - What regulation does it support?
 - How is data use of technology a part of this policy?
 - What type of regulation is this (i.e., consumer, industrial, governmental, other)?
 - Who does the regulation protect?
 - Who is the party that the regulation restricts in some way. Why?

## GitHub and Markdown

 - First, please familiarize yourself with GitHub. For example, [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) provides a good reference guide. If you require more help, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).
